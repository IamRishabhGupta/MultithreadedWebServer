This repository demonstrates a multi-threaded server and client application in Java, emphasizing concurrency and efficient client handling. The server listens on port 8010 and leverages `ServerSocket` and `Socket` classes, creating a new thread for each client connection to handle simultaneous interactions. Upon client connection, the server sends a greeting message. The client application connects to the server, sends a message, and processes the response. Key technologies and concepts include Java I/O, multithreading, socket programming, and network communication. Additionally, the repository includes an advanced multithreaded web server capable of serving HTTP clients, further showcasing efficient resource management and concurrency in a web environment.
